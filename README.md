Facet API
==========

The Facet API module allows site builders to easily create and manage faceted
search interfaces. In addition to the UI components that come out of the box,
themers and module developers can build their own widgets that can optionally
be contributed back to Drupal.org. Facet API works with the core Search, Search API,
and Apache Solr Search Integration modules (including Acquia Search) meaning
that code and configuration can be reused as-is with the most popular search
solutions available to Drupal. Refer to the documentation for more details.
